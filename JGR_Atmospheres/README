README file for codes within respository

Codes L_Tdy_DPI_PI estimates mixing depth (L), integrated temperature to that mixing depth (Tdy),
dynamic potential intensity based on Tdy, and estimates potential intensity using SST for comparison.
These formulations comes from Balaguru et al. (2015, GRL) and Emanuel(1999, Nature)

This funciton uses the functions get_mld.m to estimate mixed layer depth, qsat.m to estimate saturation
specific humidity, and the saltwater density toolbox function sw_pden.m to estimate potential density.

Specific inputs/outputs per function are listed within each code.
